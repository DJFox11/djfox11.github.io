        <p class="disclaimer"><i>Disclaimer: You will need to source a usable NSP/XCI of the game yourself. This tutorial will not contain instructions on installing/setting up Ryujinx and Yuzu; it is assumed you already have this knowledge.</i></p>
        
        <h2>You Will Need:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>A NSP/XCI of the game (NSP: Nintendo Submission Package. XCI: Game Cartridge Image)</li>
            <li>Yuzu/Ryujinx (for extracting the base game)</li>
            <li>Switch Toolbox (for extracting models and textures)</li>
            <li>Blender, or any modeling software of choice (for testing/viewing the model, creating the icons for submission)</li>
            <li>Model Checker (for checking any issues with the model. <i>Note: It will not guarantee model approval.</i>)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Extracting the Game:</h2>
        <h3>For Yuzu:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Ensure Super Mario Odyssey appears in the games list.</li>
            <li>Right-click the game and click Dump RomFS &gt; Dump RomFS.</li>
            <li>A new window should appear asking how you would like the game dumped. Select "Full". Wait for the extraction to complete.</li>
            <li>Navigate to the "ObjectData" folder in the dumped game directory. Keep note of the directory for later.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>For Ryujinx:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Ensure Super Mario Odyssey appears in the games list.</li>
            <li>Right-click the game and select Extract Data &gt; RomFS, then choose a location for the dump. Keep note of the directory for later.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Extracting and Converting the Models (Switch Toolbox):</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Extract the downloaded .ZIP archive called "Toolbox-Latest.ZIP". Inside the extracted archive, open "Toolbox.EXE".</li>
            <li>Go to File &gt; Open (Folder), and navigate to the extracted RomFS of Super Mario Odyssey. Select the ObjectData folder and click "Select Folder".</li>
            <li>You should see a long list of .SZS files inside. These are packages containing models, textures, animations, and other files. Find the model you would like to extract and double-click on the respective .SZS file.</li>
            <li>Inside the .SZS, you should see a .BFRES file. Double-click on it to open your model in the viewport to the left. The "Models" folder is what we need to use.</li>
            <li>Click the + icon for the "Models" folder, then right-click the model underneath that folder. Click "Extract" and choose a spot for the model. Make sure to extract it as a .DAE file.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Importing the Model (Blender):</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Open Blender and go to File &gt; Import &gt; Collada (.dae) and select the extracted model.</li>
            <li>Once imported, scale the model down to a reasonable size (e.g., 0.01).</li>
            <li>If creating icons, head to the "Shading" workspace. Assign textures to the model.</li>
        </ol>
